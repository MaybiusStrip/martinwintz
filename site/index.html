        <h1>I'm a developer by trade.</h1>
        <p>I believe coding is a craft. It requires tremendous skill, creativity, and passion to build great software quickly. As a result, there is a vast range of quality when it comes to developers, and I strive to be at the top.</p>
         <p>My priority is always timely delivery of working software. However, I feel strongly about writing expressive, beautiful code. I believe that love and attention to detail at all levels, regardless of their visibility to the client, are a pre-requisite to a great product.</p>
         <hr />
         <p>I started writing code when I was 10 and had a primitive grasp of Java and C++ by the time I graudated junior high. I continued coding through high school, getting my first web development gig around 2005 writing AJAX when it was still fresh, and went on to get a Bachelor's at Pomona College for computer science, focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
         <p>I returned to web development by building an internal web-app for Bio-Rad to manage all their B2B contracts. I then moved to NYC and started work at Newscred, where I currently work on their flagship Marketing Cloud product.</p>
